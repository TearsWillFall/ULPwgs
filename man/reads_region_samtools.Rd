\usage{
reads_region_samtools(
  bin_samtools = build_default_tool_binary_list()$bin_samtools,
  bam = NULL,
  region = NULL,
  accepted_id = "accepted",

}
\arguments{
\item{bin_samtools}{Path to samtools executable. Default: from build_default_tool_binary_list().}

\item{bam}{Path to the input BAM file. (Required)}

\item{region}{Genomic region to extract (e.g., "1:10000-1000000"). (Required)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to environment setup and job execution.}
}
\value{
No direct return value. Output files are written to disk and tracked in the environment.
}
\description{
This function extracts reads from a specified genomic region in a BAM file using samtools. The extracted reads are written to a new BAM file, which is then sorted and indexed. The output files are tracked in the environment.
