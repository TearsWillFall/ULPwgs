\title{Extract Discordant Reads from BAM File Using Samtools}
\usage{
extract_discordant_reads_samtools(
  bin_samtools = build_default_tool_binary_list()$bin_samtools,
  bam = NULL,
  region = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bin_samtools}{Path to the samtools executable. Default: from build_default_tool_binary_list().}

\item{bam}{Path to the input BAM file. (Required)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to environment setup and job execution.}
}
\value{
No direct return value. Output BAM file with discordant reads is written to disk and tracked in the environment.
}
\description{
This function extracts discordant reads from a BAM file using samtools. Discordant reads are those that do not meet expected pairing criteria (e.g., improper orientation or distance). The extracted reads are written to a new BAM file, optionally restricted to a specific genomic region.
